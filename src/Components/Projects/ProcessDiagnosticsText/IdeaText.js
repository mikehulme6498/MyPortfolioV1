                The idea was to create software that would read through each text file and extract all the information into digital 
                and manageable data. This could then be stored in a database and queried as needed.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a result, all the information would be retrievable in seconds! Due to this, the reports can then be used to their 
                full potential.
                <br />
                Here is a list of the proposed benefits.
            </p>

            <ul className="ul-in-paragraph">
                <li>Batch reports are broken down and easy to understand.</li>
                <li>Stoppage data for engineers to plan maintenance.</li>
                <li>Potential quality issues are highlighted.</li>
                <li>Material Overweigh / Underweigh data.</li>
                <li>Use data to create control charts to prevent issues before they happen.</li>
                <li>Compliance data for the entire plant.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                All of the above is not currently possible without spending 100â€™s of hours gathering the data manually.
                The software will be designed so all the above is easy to obtain for any user of the software.
            </p>
