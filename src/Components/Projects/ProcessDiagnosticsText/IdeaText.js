            <p>The idea was to create software that would read through each text file and extract all the data into digital 
                manageable data, which could be stored in a database and queried as needed.
            </p>
            <p>
                This would mean all the information would be retrievable in seconds. Meaning the reports could be used to there 
                full potential. Here is a list of proposed benefits.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Batch reports broken down and easy to understand. (see result)</li>
                <li>Stoppage data for engineers to plan maintenance.</li>
                <li>Potential quality issues highlighted.</li>
                <li>Material Overweigh / Underway data.</li>
                <li>Use data to create control charts to prevent issues before they happend.</li>
                <li>Compliance data for the entire plant.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                All of the above is not currently possible without spending 100â€™s of hours gathering the data manually.
                The software will be designed so all the above is easy to obtain for any user of the software.
