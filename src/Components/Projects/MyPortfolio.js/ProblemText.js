                I needed a website to show my projects to potential employers, I did not want to use a pre made template
                as it defeats the object in my opinion.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have been primarely using .NET over the last two years but I was given some advice that I should learn React due to its popularity. So I decided to write my portfolio
                using it. 
            </p>
            <p>
                It was a lot of fun to learn and it actually felt quite familiar as I have been using view components in C# and the concept is exactly 
                the same.
            </p>
            <p>
                It was made using the latest features of React such as Hooks, I also used external components such as emailJs for 
                the contact form.
            </p>
        </div>
