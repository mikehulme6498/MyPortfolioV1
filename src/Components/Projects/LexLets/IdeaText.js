                The idea was to create a program to store the products as well as the materials required to make the product. 
                It would also track the quantities used for each item enabling us to manage stock levels more efficiently.

            <p>
                As the sales are entered, the inventory will be adjusted and the accounts will automatically be populated and the fees and postage costs will be categorized.
            </p>
            <p>
                The yearly accounts would be available to see instantly enabling a speedy tax return.
