                The idea is to create an application that would store all the products with what materials and quantities
                are used. That way when a product is sold it can consume the materials used meaning we can keep track of
                the stock.
            </p>
            <p>
                Also when a sale is entered into the system it will add it to income on the accounts including the fees
                such as credit card / Paypal fees. A section to enter expenses would be needed.
            </p>
            <p>
                When the yearly accounts are due I will be able to just click to see the last 12 months figures for a 
                speedy tax return.
            </p>
        </div>
