            My wife runs an online jewellery store <a href="https://www.lexlets.co.uk" target="_blank"> lexlets.co.uk</a>

                She has a wide variety of beads and charms that she uses to make the bracelets and keeping track of her 
                stock levels was difficult. Often she would sell a bracelet to find she has one the materials out of stock.

                I also manage her accounts and doing so is very time-consuming and not the most enjoyable of tasks.
