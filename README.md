# My Software Portfolio V1

This site is hosted at https://www.mikehulme.co.uk

I was advised to learn react due to its popularity, so I decided to create my portfolio using it. You can see the results above, I used the new hook features such as useState, useEffect and useRef.

I also used emailjs for the contact form.
